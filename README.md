# new_ets
Get the latest ET sigs for review or search for your favourite vulnerability to see if the sigs exist.

To get the recent sigs for the most popular rulesets you can run without any options:
```
python3 et_rules.py 
```

Searching for something specific is as easy as using ```--search <whatever you want>```.

If you want to check all rulesets, rather than my canned choice, then use ```--all``` but obviously this generates a lot of output.

You may want to pipe this into a file or elsewhere.
